# 06-Python-API-Challenge
Repo for week 6 bootcamp challenge

  In this challenge we are answering the question "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"  To achieve this it was important to utilize the citipy Python library and the Open Weather Map API.  Once the data was gathered plots were created to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude. These weather variables included Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness and Wind Speed. Next the linear Regression was computed for each relationship through scatter plots.  Then the data was divided between Northern and Southern Hemisphere and plots were created for these elements as well.

  
  The second part of the challenge used both geoViews Python library and the Geoapify API.  The CSV output from part one was imported into VacationPy and then this data was used to create map visualizations.  First a map was created to show a color point for each city and the size of the point was based on the humidity percentage.  Next the dataframe was narrowed down to find my ideal weather condition.  A new data frame was created to store the city, country, coordinates and humidity.

  
  The challenge also asked for the use of Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of the coordinates.  Also to add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map.  I ran out of time to completed these but will come back to finish at a later date.
